> Could you analyse by age (60+/<60) the contribution of the HoH to the work of the farm?  Something like this: 
- none (i.e. no involvement in any of the field tasks we listed)
- management only
- management + work in the field.

>  I should have asked that you provide the HoH data by age group within the two regions.
