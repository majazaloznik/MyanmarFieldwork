# Survey Data Analysis Journal
  
## Sunday 5.2.2017 - First trawl - Univariate descriptives
  
Clean dataset arrived 30.1.2017, in .sav format. 

Installed SPSS for quick analysis, but waited for MSR report, which arrived 1.2. in hope that it may already include a descriptive analysis, but it did not. It is a pure technical report about sampling etc. To feed into methodology section. 

Original copy of data kept raw in `survey\data\raw.original.data`.

Prepare web report of univariate distributions of variables - to degree sensible. 

* remove `Q3_OT_SP` other marital status as no valid answers were given. 
* remove `Q4_96_OT_SP` other educational grade/level as no valid answers were given. 
* New variable `N1` sums up all seven disability questions Q6_A to Q6_G as number of dificulties reported, max is seven. Checks out with 'Q6_H` which reports who doesn't have any disabilities. 
* `Q7_5` on working outside of the village part of the year is wrongly coded - 1 for yes and 2 for no. Recoded all to 1 for yes and 0 for no. 
* New variable `N2` - number of hh members working outside of village part of the year. 
* New variable `N3` - number of hh members working in village in same township.
* New variable `N4` - number of hh members working in different township.
