# Survey Data Analysis Journal
  
## Sunday 5.2.2017 - First trawl - Univariate descriptives
  
Clean dataset arrived 30.1.2017, in .sav format. 

Installed SPSS for quick analysis, but waited for MSR report, which arrived 1.2. in hope that it may already include a descriptive analysis, but it did not. It is a pure technical report about sampling etc. To feed into methodology section. 

Original copy of data kept raw in `survey\data\raw.original.data`.

Prepare web report of univariate distributions of variables - to degree sensible. 

* remove `Q3_OT_SP` other marital status as no valid answers were given. 
* remove `Q4_96_OT_SP` other educational grade/level as no valid answers were given.

* **ISSUE** - `Q15`: the question reads "of the largest loan you have taken in the last 12 months, who did you borrow from" - 30 % listed more than one lender? This should not be possible. This also leaves three different"other" answers, particularly unclear how this could happen..
* New variable `N30` - number of lenders listed in answer to question 15. From `Q15_A` to `Q15_J`
* **ISSUE**: variable `Q20_B` shouldn't exist?!
* New variable `N31` - difference between acreage of land owned and that cultivated. `Q17` - `Q18`
* New variable `N32` - difference between acreage of land owned and that cultivated and or leased out. This is land left fallow, so the couple of cases with negative values are errors! [ ISSUE]. `Q17` - `Q18` - `Q20_A`
* New variable `N33` - difference between acreage of land rented and that rented and cultivated rented land left fallow, and tehre is none. `Q22` - `Q23` 

## Monday 6.2.2017 - First trawl - Univariate descriptives - continuted

* Q24B and C ask- who is responsible for managing the farming activities apart from the respondent - hh menber ID. So the in order to get relationship etc. of these people new variables are required. 
* New variable `N34` - Relationship of co-responsible manager. Form `Q24_B_ID`
* **ISSUE** - N34 should not have the value 1 = self. Becasue that means they have answered "me and another family member" and the other family memeber is me. But there are 6 such people.
* New variable `N35` - Relationship ofother household member that is listed as responsible for farm management.  Form `Q24_C_ID`
* Check that N34 and N35 have no overlapp, correct.
* New variable `N36` - relationship of other household memebr that is either co- or solely responsible for farm management.  form `N34` and `N35`
* Check that Q25 "used to manage" is asked of right people - those who say now other family member manages in Q24. correct. 
* Check that Q26 "when used to manage" is asked of right people - those who said they used to manage in Q25. correct. 
* Check that Q27 "go check the field daily" is asked of right people, those that said they manage or co-manage in Q24. correct. 
* Q28 question "when no longer able to visit land" - each option is coded as separate variables for yes/no and tehn for relationship. Instead I merge them.
* New variable `N37` - "Will co-manage with child(-in-law)" from `Q28_A` and `Q28_A_OT_SP`. 
* New variable `N38` - "Will hand over to child(-in-law)" from `Q28_B` and `Q28_B_OT_SP`. 
* New variable `N39` - "Will co-manage with other relative" from `Q28_C` and `Q28_C_OT_SP`. 
* New variable `N40` - "Will hand over to other relative" from `Q28_D` and `Q28_D_OT_SP`. 
* New variable `N41` - "Will do something else" from `Q28_G` and `Q28_G_OT_SP`. 
* **ISSUE** - Q28 should have had "One option only" - but in the end 31 people gave two options. 
* New variable `N46` - how Q28 should look like - with all options given. BUT, because of multiple answers, these are given additionally. (variables N42-N45 are temporary)
* New variable `N47` has the size of your land increased in any way in the past five years from `Q30_A`, `Q30_B`, AND `Q30_C`.  
* New variable `N48` the total acreage of increase - sum of bought, rented and ingherited in from `Q30_A_ACRE`, `Q30_B_ACRE`, AND `Q30_C_ACRE`.  
* New variable `N49` - number of responses on reduction of land size.   `Q31`: this was a multiple response question, but **ISSUE** of the 44 respondents that had had a decrease in land size, all had only one reason (sold, rented, confiscated, gave away or lost to river errosion). This seems unlikely!?

## Tuesday 7.2.2017 - First trawl - Univariate descriptives - continuted

*New variable `N50` - all five Q31_A questions consolidated - "Reason for decrease in farm size in last five years". From `Q31_A1`, `Q31_A2`, `Q31_A3`, `Q31_A4`, `Q31_A5`.
* New variable `N51`- all five Q31_B questions  consolidated - "Total number of acrers of decrease in farm size in last five years."  From `Q31_B1`, `Q31_B2`, `Q31_B3`, `Q31_B4`, `Q31_B5`.
* Resason in Q31 should be single answer. But each is coded as three answers. But still, turns out they were answered only once. So need to colsolidate each of the five sets of variables.. **ISSUE** Instead of five variables there are 20 here..
* New variable `N52` "Reason for selling land" - from  `Q31_C1_1`, `Q31_C1_2`, `Q31_C1_3`, `Q31_C1_3_OT_SP`.
* New variable `N53` "Reason for letting out land" - from  `Q31_C2_1`, `Q31_C2_2`, `Q31_C2_3`, `Q31_C2_3_OT_SP`.
* New variable `N54` "Reason for giving away land" - from  `Q31_C3_1`, `Q31_C3_2`, `Q31_C3_3`, `Q31_C3_3_OT_SP`. **ISSUE** Two people said they gave away land because of debt. This doesn't make sense - this combination of variables should not have occured. 
* New variable `N55` "Reason for confiscation of land" - from  `Q31_C4_1`, `Q31_C4_2`, `Q31_C4_3`, `Q31_C4_3_OT_SP`. **ISSUE** Confusion here: reason for confiscation given as confiscation!? Also the reason given as "rob" is not clear, was land stolen from someone?
* New variable `N56` "Other reason decrease in land size" - from  `Q31_C5_1`, `Q31_C5_2`, `Q31_C5_3`, `Q31_C4_3_OT_SP`.
* New variabel `N57` "Reason for decrease in land size " - from all 20 `Q31_C` variables consolidated. 
* **ISSUE** All 9 Yes No questions under 'Q32' are coded Yes = 1 and No = 2 Instead of No = 0..
* New variable `N59` "type of crop production for first crop" - what type of combinaiton of subsistence, animal feed and sale from `Q32_1_1` to `Q32_1_3`.
* New variable `N61` "type of crop production for second crop" - what type of combinaiton of subsistence, animal feed and sale from `Q32_2_1` to `Q32_2_3`.
* New variable `N63` "type of crop production for third crop" - what type of combinaiton of subsistence, animal feed and sale from `Q32_3_1` to `Q32_3_3`.
* New variable `N64` "Do you personaly perform land preparation (ploughing) and if not anymore, how long ago did you stop?". Consolidated from `Q33_A` and `Q33_A1`. 
* New variable `N65` "Do you personaly perform harvesting and if not anymore, how long ago did you stop?". Consolidated from `Q33_B` and `Q33_B1`.
